## Quick Start Guide

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses React 19. Some dependencies require the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag during installation. Make sure that Vercel's install command is also set to use `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`!

Then, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Note: You will need to populate the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOG_ID` variable with the Blog ID obtained from wisp after you've created an account.

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
