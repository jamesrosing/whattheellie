## Validation Summary

**Total Items**: 120
**Completed**: 120 ✓
**Failed**: 0
**Needs Clarification**: 0

**Status**: ✅ **APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

The specification meets all quality standards and is ready for the planning phase. All constitution principles are satisfied, technical constraints are clear, and implementation guidance is sufficient for a developer to begin work.

**Next Steps**:
1. Run `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
2. Run `/speckit.tasks` to create task breakdown
3. Begin implementation following generated tasks
