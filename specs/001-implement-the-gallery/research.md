# Research: Gallery Grid Homepage

**Feature**: Gallery Grid Homepage
**Branch**: `001-implement-the-gallery`
**Date**: 2025-01-15

## Research Summary

This feature requires NO additional research. All technical decisions are based on existing, proven patterns from the project's fal template reference and established tech stack.

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Grid Layout Implementation
**Decision**: Use CSS Grid with Tailwind utilities (`grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4`)
**Rationale**:
- CSS Grid provides native responsive layout without JavaScript overhead
- Tailwind utilities ensure consistency with existing design system
- Matches proven pattern from fal project GalleryHomeTemplate.tsx
- Performs better than flex-based grids (no row wrapping calculations)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Masonry Layout** (rejected): Would require JavaScript library (Masonry.js or react-grid-layout), adds bundle size, complicates Server Component architecture
- **Flexbox Grid** (rejected): Requires manual row management, less semantic than CSS Grid
- **Table-based Grid** (rejected): Poor accessibility, not responsive-friendly

### Decision 2: Image Optimization Strategy
**Decision**: Continue using Next.js Image component with existing configuration
**Rationale**:
- Already configured for imagedelivery.net remote patterns (next.config.mjs:7)
- Built-in lazy loading, blur-up placeholder, format optimization
- No additional dependencies required
- Maintains Server Component compatibility

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Cloudinary/Imgix** (rejected): Unnecessary complexity, Wisp CMS already provides optimized images
- **Custom lazy loading** (rejected): Would reinvent Next.js Image features, increase maintenance burden
- **Native <img> tags** (rejected): Loses performance optimizations (lazy load, responsive images, format conversion)

### Decision 3: Hover Interaction Implementation
**Decision**: Use CSS pseudo-classes (`:hover`) with Tailwind `group` utilities
**Rationale**:
- Zero JavaScript required (maintains Server Component architecture)
- GPU-accelerated transforms (scale, opacity) for smooth performance
- Matches fal template pattern: `group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity duration-300`
- Mobile-friendly (hover states ignored on touch devices automatically)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **JavaScript event handlers** (rejected): Would require 'use client' directive, breaks Principle I (Server Components First)
- **Framer Motion animations** (rejected): Adds 12KB gzipped, unnecessary for simple hover effects
- **CSS animations** (rejected): More complex than transitions, less performant for simple state changes

### Decision 4: Typography for Hover Titles
**Decision**: Use existing Garamond font with Tailwind font-light utilities
**Rationale**:
- Font already loaded in project (font-garamond class exists in BlogPostPreview.tsx:33)
- Matches travel blog aesthetic (elegant, readable)
- No additional font loading overhead
- Consistent with existing post title styling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **New font (Playfair Display, Merriweather)** (rejected): Would require font loading, increase LCP, violate Principle VI (Performance-First)
- **System fonts** (rejected): Loses brand consistency with existing design
- **Sans-serif (Inter, Roboto)** (rejected): Doesn't match elegant travel blog aesthetic

### Decision 5: Component Architecture
**Decision**: Refactor BlogPostPreview.tsx, keep BlogPostsPreview as wrapper
**Rationale**:
- Existing component structure supports grid layout with className prop
- Server Component architecture preserved (no 'use client' needed)
- Maintains separation: BlogPostPreview = single item, BlogPostsPreview = grid container
- Existing fade-in-up animation can be preserved

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **New GalleryGrid component** (rejected): Duplicates existing BlogPostsPreview functionality
- **Inline grid in page.tsx** (rejected): Reduces reusability, complicates testing
- **Client Component with state** (rejected): Violates Principle I (Server Components First)

## Performance Optimizations

### Optimization 1: Lazy Loading Strategy
- **Approach**: Rely on Next.js Image's native lazy loading (loading="lazy" by default)
- **Impact**: Images load only when approaching viewport (reduces initial page weight)
- **Implementation**: No code changes required, feature already active in BlogPostPreview.tsx:23

### Optimization 2: Image Size Selection
- **Approach**: Use Next.js Image's automatic srcset generation for responsive images
- **Impact**: Mobile devices download smaller images (saves bandwidth on 3G)
- **Implementation**: Ensure `fill` prop on Image component (already implemented)

### Optimization 3: Animation Performance
- **Approach**: Use GPU-accelerated properties only (transform, opacity)
- **Impact**: Animations run at 60fps without layout thrashing
- **Implementation**: `transition-transform duration-500 group-hover:scale-110` (transforms are GPU-accelerated)

## No Additional Research Required

The following areas require **ZERO** research as they use existing, documented patterns:

- ✅ Wisp CMS API integration (already implemented in src/lib/wisp.ts)
- ✅ TypeScript types for blog posts (GetPostsResult["posts"][0] already exists)
- ✅ Error handling (existing error boundary in page.tsx:44-56)
- ✅ Pagination (POSTS_PER_PAGE constant already configured)
- ✅ Dark mode support (Tailwind dark: variants already configured)
- ✅ Accessibility (semantic HTML, alt text patterns already established)
- ✅ Build process (npm run build with --legacy-peer-deps already configured)

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Placeholder Image Missing
**Risk**: `/images/placeholder.webp` may not exist
**Likelihood**: Low (already referenced in BlogPostPreview.tsx:26)
**Impact**: Broken images if post.image is null
**Mitigation**: Verify file exists before implementation, use existing fallback

### Risk 2: Grid Aspect Ratio on Extreme Screens
**Risk**: Very wide screens (>2560px) may show excessive columns
**Likelihood**: Low (< 1% of users)
**Impact**: Images become too small to appreciate
**Mitigation**: Consider max-width container on homepage (already exists: `container mx-auto`)

### Risk 3: Animation Performance on Low-End Devices
**Risk**: Hover scale animation may stutter on old mobile devices
**Likelihood**: Medium (travel blog users often on mobile)
**Impact**: Degraded UX but not blocking
**Mitigation**: CSS transitions gracefully degrade; modern browsers optimize transforms

## Implementation Readiness

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

All technical decisions made. No additional research or prototyping required. Proceed directly to Phase 1 (data-model.md and quickstart.md generation).

**Estimated Complexity**: **Low**
- 2 files to modify (BlogPostPreview.tsx, page.tsx)
- 1 optional file (globals.css for animations)
- Zero new dependencies
- Zero API changes
- Zero database schema changes
